        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>Steak Rub and Steak:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Montreal steak seasoning</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons onion powder</li>
            <li>1 (2 3/4 pound) tomahawk steak (3-inch thick bone-in ribeye)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Compound Butter:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup salted butter, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced shallots</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons reserved steak rub</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <h4>Step 1</h4>
            <p>To make steak rub, place brown sugar, Montreal steak seasoning, garlic powder, and onion powder in a small airtight container; shake or stir to combine.
                <br>Set aside 2 teaspoons steak rub to use in compound butter.</p>       

        <h4>Step 2</h4>
            <p>Place steak on a half sheet pan, and rub steak on top, bottom, and sides with remaining steak rub until well coated.
                <br>Place steak, uncovered, in the refrigerator to dry-brine overnight.</p>

        <h4>Step 3</h4>
            <p>For compound butter, place butter, shallot, garlic, chives, and the reserved 2 teaspoons steak rub in a small bowl.
                <br>Mash together with a fork until evenly combined.
                <br>Spoon butter into a small airtight container, cover, and refrigerate until ready to use. </p>

        <h4>Step 4</h4>
            <p>Remove steak from the refrigerator 1 hour before cooking to take the chill off. It will cook on the sheet pan that you used for dry-brining.</p>

        <h4>Step 5</h4>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). The reverse sear method is used to cook this big steak, so you will need an instant-read thermometer.
                <br>If you are using a digital meat thermometer, set the internal temperature to 110 degrees F (43 degrees C). </p>

        <h4>Step 6</h4>
            <p>Bake steak on the sheet pan in the preheated oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads 110 degrees F (43 degrees C), about 45 minutes. Begin checking the temperature at 30 minutes.</p>

        <h4>Step 7</h4>
            <p>During the last 15 to 20 minutes of cooking time, preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</p>

        <h4>Step 8</h4>
            <p>When steak reaches an internal temperature of  110 degrees F (43 degrees C) measured with an instant-read thermometer, remove it from the oven.</p>

        <h4>Step 9</h4>
            <p>Grill steak directly on the grates of the preheated grill; sear on both sides, about 2 minutes per side.
                <br>This is a fatty piece of meat, so be mindful of flame flare-ups.
                <br>The internal temperature should now read 125 to 135 degrees F (51 to 57 degrees C) for medium rare.</p>

        <h4>Step 10</h4>
            <p>Remove steak from the grill, and smear compound butter over top.
                <br>Let butter melt into the steak, heating up the fresh garlic, shallots, and chives. Let steak rest for 10 minutes.</p>

        <h4>Step 11</h4>
            <p>Slice steak and serve with accumulated juices and melted butter. Be sure to serve the bone-someone will want to gnaw on it!</p>
